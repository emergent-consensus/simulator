# Mining Simulator

The mining simulator is an interactive game that allows players to simulate mining Bitcoin.  They will rent hashpower to attempt to find the next block.  The game will be on a 1/60th timescale to Bitcoin, where blocks are mined every 10 seconds, instead of every 10 minutes, allowing for interactive play.
